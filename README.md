# 🎧 Emotion Recognition from Speech

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from speech audio using deep learning and speech signal processing.  
By analyzing audio features such as MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), the model can classify emotions like happy, angry, sad, neutral, and more.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a model capable of detecting emotional states from human voice samples by leveraging audio processing and neural network architectures.

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts MFCC and other acoustic features from speech.  
- Trains deep learning models like CNN, RNN, or LSTM.  
- Supports popular emotion datasets such as RAVDESS, TESS, and EMO-DB.  
- Predicts emotional labels from unseen speech inputs.  
- Can be extended to real-time emotion recognition systems.  

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Librosa (for audio feature extraction)  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load and preprocess audio data.  
2. Extract MFCCs and other relevant speech features.  
3. Feed extracted features into a deep learning model (CNN, RNN, or LSTM).  
4. Train and validate the model on emotion-labeled datasets.  
5. Predict the emotion of new speech samples.
